      Im a professional web engineer with 4+ years of professional experience as a front-end developer and 3+ years as a back-end developer.<br>  

      I started my career path 7 years ago right after see the social network movie (facebook), at the same day I created my first web site with html5 and css3, a week later I learned jquery and one month later I learned php and MySQL.<br>  

      when I not coding or working, I like to see a lot of documentaries about the history or the future, do some coding challenge, learn how to code better and clearly and spend time with my family.<br>  

      Im currently working with the following technologies: On the front side, I use React.js, Redux, Redux-form, Sass or Scss, styled-components, html5, and CSS.<br>  

      On the backside, I use Node.js, Express.js, Koa.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Squel.js , JSON web token and Nest.js with typescript
      On DevOps side, I use AWS, bitbucket pipelines, Docker, Heroku.<br>  

      Im always open to trying a new technology.
